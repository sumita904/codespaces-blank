In testing, an SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) is an IT expert who can operate equally well in development and testing. SDETs are involved in every step of the software development and testing process. The knowledge of SDET professionals is entirely focused on software testing and development process testability, robustness, and performance. They can also participate as a contributor or reviewer in the development of production software designs. Currently, businesses are looking for a professional who can assist with software development. At the same time, he should be in charge of evaluating the software that has been produced. That is why hiring SDET is beneficial to them because they can work on high-performance code or testing framework creation.
Microsoft was the first to do so, but other companies are now taking notice, and they're seeking someone who is an expert in SDET to help them with the whole development of their product, as well as the testing design that must be carried out for that specific development. The company can use the same resource for two critical jobs that will always be profitable.
In this article, we have covered the most frequently asked interview questions for the profile of Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET). For a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET), it is essential to be thorough with the principles of software testing as well.
Tester: A tester is someone who performs software testing in order to find flaws. The tester additionally examines several features of the software. The tester is unaware of the software development process. A tester examines the software to see whether it contains any faults or flaws.
The following table lists the differences between an SDET and a Manual Tester:
Genuine users of the software application undertake beta testing in a real environment. One type of User Acceptance Testing is beta testing. A small number of end-users of the product are given a beta version of the program in order to receive input on the product quality. Beta testing reduces the chances of a product failing and improves the product's quality by allowing customers to validate it.
Following are the different types of beta testing :
Alpha testing is a type of software testing that is used to find issues before a product is released to real users or the general public. One type of user acceptability testing is alpha testing. It is referred to as alpha testing since it is done early in the software development process, near the ending. Homestead software developers or quality assurance staff frequently undertake alpha testing. It's the final level of testing before the software is released into the real world.
Following are the objectives of alpha testing:
The following table lists the differences between priority and severity -
Priority is divided into three categories :
The bugs are usually assigned priority labels like P0, P1, P2 and so on, where P0 denotes the bug with the highest priority.
There are five types of severity :
Following are the roles and responsibilities of a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) :
Following are the do’s for a good bug report :
Following are the don’ts for a good bug report :
Following are the elements of a bug report :
A bug report is a detailed report which explains what is incorrect and needs to be fixed in software or on a website. The report includes a request and/or details for how to address each issue, as well as a list of causes or noticed faults to point out exactly what is perceived as wrong. Bug reports are a technique to inform developers about parts of their code that aren't behaving as expected or designed, allowing them to see which parts of their software need to be improved. This can be a difficult effort for the developer, and without enough information, it is nearly impossible. Fortunately, testers may make this process considerably easier by producing high-quality bug reports that include all of the information a developer might need to locate the problem.
Code inspection is a sort of static testing that involves inspecting software code and looking for flaws. It simplifies the initial error detection procedure, lowering the defect multiplication ratio and avoiding subsequent stage error detection. This code inspection is actually part of the application evaluation procedure.
Following are the key steps involved in code inspection :
Following are the advantages of Code Inspection :
Ad hoc testing is a type of unstructured or informal software testing that seeks to interrupt the testing process in order to uncover potential defects or errors as soon as feasible. Ad hoc testing is a type of testing that is done at random and is usually an unplanned activity that does not use any documentation or test design methodologies to construct test cases. 
Ad-hoc testing is done on any portion of the application at random and does not follow any standardized testing procedures. The primary goal of this testing is to detect problems through random inspection. Error Guessing, a software testing approach, can be used to perform ad hoc testing. People with adequate familiarity with the system can "predict" the most likely source of errors, which is known as error guessing. This testing does not necessitate any paperwork, planning, or procedure. Because this testing seeks to detect faults through a random technique, defects will not be mapped to test cases if there is no documentation. This means that reproducing errors can be difficult at times because there are no test processes or requirements associated with them.
Risk-based testing (RBT) is a method of software testing that is based on risk likelihood. It entails analyzing the risk based on software complexity, business criticality, frequency of use, and probable Defect areas, among other factors. Risk-based testing prioritizes testing of software programme aspects and functions that are more important and likely to have flaws.
Risk is the occurrence of an unknown event that has a positive or negative impact on a project's measured success criteria. It could be something that happened in the past, something that is happening now, or something that will happen in the future. These unforeseen events might have an impact on a project's cost, business, technical, and quality goals.
Risks can be positive or negative. Positive risks are referred to as opportunities, and they aid in the long-term viability of a corporation. Investing in a new project, changing corporate processes, and developing new products are just a few examples.
Negative risks are also known as threats, and strategies to reduce or eliminate them are necessary for project success.
The following table lists the differences between black box and white box testing: 
Walkthrough - A walkthrough is a technique for doing a quick group or individual review. In a walkthrough, the author describes and explains his work product to his peers or supervisor in an informal gathering to receive comments. The legitimacy of the suggested work product solution is checked here. It is less expensive to make adjustments while the design is still on paper rather than during conversion. A walkthrough is a form of quality assurance that is done in a static manner. Walkthroughs are casual gatherings with a purpose.
The following table lists the differences between walkthrough and inspection -
Test scripts are a line-by-line description of the system transactions that must be done in order to validate the application or system under test. Each step should be listed in the test script, along with the intended outcomes. This automation script enables software testers to thoroughly test each stage on a variety of devices. The actual items to be executed, as well as the expected results, must be included in the test script.
The following table lists the differences between test case and test script :
Fuzz Testing is a software testing technique that utilizes erroneous, unexpected, or random data as input and then looks for exceptions like crashes and memory leaks. It's a type of automated testing that's used to define system testing techniques that use a randomized or dispersed approach. During fuzz testing, a system or software program may have a variety of data input problems or glitches.
Following are the different phases of Fuzz Testing:
Following are the different types of bugs detected by fuzz testing:
In this case, the interviewer is most interested in learning more about you.
If you can relate to the problem, you can use real-life circumstances to answer such questions. You should also explain that you would not be willing to deliver any code to production without proper testing.When it comes to essential fixes, you should always collaborate with the developer to figure out what areas they might affect and set up a non-production environment to test the change. It's also worth noting that you'll continue to monitor the fix (using monitoring tools, dashboards, logs, and so on) after it's been deployed to look for any anomalous behaviour in the production environment and ensure that the fix hasn't had any negative consequences.
These questions usually ask the interviewer to grasp your thinking as a leader, as well as what you would compromise on and whether you would be prepared to produce a flawed product in exchange for less time.Answers to these questions should be supported by the candidate's actual experiences.
For example, you may say that in the past, you had to make a decision to release a hotfix, but it couldn't be tested since the integration environment was unavailable. So you rolled it out in stages, starting with a small proportion and then monitoring logs/events before launching the complete rollout, and so on.
These types of questions are open-ended, so you may take the conversation in any direction you desire. You can also highlight your strong talents, knowledge, and technological areas.
You can, for example, use instances of the Automation Strategy you used while constructing a product in a previous capacity to respond to these types of inquiries.
For example, you could say things like,
Equivalence Class Partitioning (ECP) is another name for the Equivalence Partitioning Method. It is a software testing technique, often known as black-box testing, that splits the input domain into data classes from which test cases can be constructed. An ideal test case identifies a type of error that may necessitate the execution of a large number of arbitrary test cases before a general error is detected. Equivalence classes are evaluated for given input conditions in equivalence partitioning. When any input is given, the type of input condition is examined, and the Equivalence class defines or explains a collection of valid or invalid states for this input condition.
Because this is such a crucial decision, it has never been taken by a single individual or by junior guys. This choice is not made solely by the developer and tester; senior management is involved on a regular basis. Management tests primarily ensure that product delivery is bug-free by validating the following:
The following table lists the differences between Performance Testing and Load Testing :
Following are some of the software testing tools used in the industry :
The following table lists the differences between alpha testing and beta testing:
Example:
Input: 
Output:
Explanation:
The array contains a triplet (12, 3 and 9) whose sum is 24.
Input: 
Output: 
Explanation: 
There is a triplet (5, 3 and 1) present in the array whose sum is 9.
Approach:
The algorithm's performance can be increased by sorting the array. The two-pointer technique is used in this effective method. Fix the first element of the triplet by traversing the array. Find if there is a pair whose total equals x – array[i] using the Two Pointers technique. Because the two pointers approach takes linear time, it is preferable to a nested loop.
Code:
Output:
Explanation:
In the above code, the function findTriplet takes the input of an array, the size of the array and the sum required. First of all, we sort the array given. We traverse the array elements and fix the first element of the triplet in each iteration. We use a two-pointer approach and find the remaining two elements of the triplet, if it is possible with the given array.
Example:
Input:
Output:
In practically all interviews, factorial is one of the most frequently asked questions (including developer interviews) Developer interviews place a greater emphasis on programming concepts such as dynamic programming, recursion, and so on, whereas Software Development Engineer in Test interviews place a greater emphasis on handling edge scenarios such as max values, min values, negative values, and so on, and approach/efficiency becomes secondary.
The following recursive formula can be used to calculate factorial.
Code:
Output:
Explanation:In the above code, the function findFactorial finds the factorial of a given input number. Before making the function call, we check if the given number is negative. Negative numbers do not have a factorial and so we must display appropriate messages for it. 
By balanced string, it is meant that every opening parenthesis should have its corresponding closing braces and there must not be redundant closing braces.
Example :
Input :
Output :
Input:
Output:
Approach:
We create a character stack and now look through the expression string. If the current character is a beginning bracket ('(', ", or '['), stack it. If the current character is a closing bracket (') or " or ']'), pop from the stack; if the popped character is the matching starting bracket, all is well; otherwise, the brackets are unbalanced. If some starting brackets remain in the stack after traversal, the stack is said to be "unbalanced."
Code:
Output :
Explanation:
In the above code, we create a function checkBalancedExpression which takes the input of an expression string and checks whether the string is balanced or not. We start traversing the expression. Whenever we encounter an opening bracket, we push it in the stack. In the case of a closing bracket, we first check if the stack is empty or not. If it is empty, we directly return false otherwise, we check if the top element has the corresponding opening bracket or not. 
Example : 
Input: 
Output: 
Approach:
We follow a greedy approach. We start extracting each digit from the original number from the end and keep on adding it at the end of the new number, thereby reversing the given number.
Code:
Output :
Explanation :
In the above code, the function reverseNumber takes the input of an integer number and returns the reverse of the number. We extract each digit from the end and append it to the new number.
The goal is to find a sum in one of the two numbers provided. The total and subtraction from the sum can then be used to swap the integers.
Code:
Output :
Explanation :In the above code, we first stored the sum of both the numbers in the first variable. Then, we store the original value of the first variable in the second variable by subtracting the second variable from the sum. Similarly we change the value for the second variable as well. Thus, we swapped the two numbers without using a third variable.
To swap two variables, use the bitwise XOR operator. When two integers x and y are XORed, the result is a number with all bits set to 1 wherever the bits of x and y differ. For instance, the XOR of 10 (in Binary 1010) and 5 (in Binary 0101) is 1111, while the XOR of 7 (0111) and 5 (0101) is 1111. (0010). We can then xor the resultant XORed with the other number to swap the values. Considering the above example, when we xor 1111 with 0101 we get 1010.
Code :
Output :
Explanation :
In the above code, we first stored the xor of both the numbers in the first variable. Then, we store the original value of the first variable in the second variable by XORing the second variable with the sum. Similarly, we change the value for the second variable as well. Thus, we swapped the two numbers without using a third variable.
