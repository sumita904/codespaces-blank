Mumbai, the capital city of Maharashtra state, was formerly known as Bombay. Now, it is also considered the financial and commercial capital of the country. The mega city has strong historical links, wonderful British architecture, museums, shrines, beaches and the Hindi film industry which is also known as Bollywood. The seven islands which form the metropolis were earlier home to fishing communities. For centuries, the islands were being controlled by the successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese and later to the East India Company of Great Britain. During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped with the construction of major roads and railways and subsequently it transformed into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea as we see it today. The city was renamed Mumbai in 1996. The happening city carries a vibrant and cosmopolitan culture. Be it Bollywood or Victorian-era buildings, Asia's largest slum in Dharavi or the lunchbox delivery and return system of the famous dabbawalas, every aspect of Mumbai boasts a unique identity.About usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesFOLLOW US ONOther Times Group News SitesThe Economic TimesHindi Economic TimesNavbharat TimesMaharashtra TimesVijaya KarnatakaTelugu SamayamTamil SamayamMalayalam SamayamI am GujaratTimesPointsIndiatimesBrand CapitalEducation TimesTimes FoodMumbai MirrorBangalore MirrorMX PlayerHindi PodcastPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth+ TipsIndian TV ShowsCelebrity PhotosTechnology NewsHot on the WebDeepika Padukone HouseDiljit DosanjhStree 2 CollectionVitamin B 12Weight GainVitaminsKanjeevaram SariAgra Heavy RainSister ShivaniDarlington Michaels Death NewsTop TrendsMoin KhanShreyas IyerJurgen MullerTravis KelceVande MetroYuvraj SinghTech LayoffsShannon SharpeIND vs PAK Asian Champions LiveKolkata Doctor Rape CaseVinesh PhogatDalit Boycott KarnatakaPM ModiHaitian Immigrant OhioMichaela DeprinceJonty RhodesLive Cricket ScoreTrending TopicsWorld Largest HorseEID WishesGreen Apple BenefitsPriyanka Chopra TattooKottukkaali OTT ReleaseNarendra ModiGhaziabad Juice SellerHair LossSudha MurtyMalayalam ProducersIndia's Best Dancer 4Simi GarewalDilli BabuIndian National ParksLaung BenefitsVikas SethiApple iPhone 16Donald TrumpAadhar Card UpdateWordle AnswerLiving and entertainmentETimesTravel DestinationsCricbuzz.comTVLifestyleNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTimes PrimeWhats HotServicesCouponDuniaTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgetsCareersColombiaLatest NewsKaun Banega Crorepati 16: Can you guess the answer for this Rs 3,20,000 question on Navy, which contestant Naman Jain incorrectly answered?IIM Jammu hosts 'Fostering Academia and Industry Partnerships' event at BengalaruMP Bharat, TDP Andhra President Srinivas promise action to safeguard protection of steel plant workersLiverpool slump to shock 1-0 home defeat by Nottingham ForestVinith Venkatesh scores in ISL debut as Bengaluru FC edge past East BengalJitendra Jorwal takes charge as new Ludhiana deputy commissioner, vows seamless delivery of servicesAnanya Panday urges all industries to form Hema Committee': 'Clearly, no one else is doing it but women'Nine arrested on charges of assaulting a Dalit woman at Kallukunta village in Kurnool district'Calling all Swifties for Trump': Donald's new campaign merch imitates Eras Tour shirtsWWE Hall of Famer Watches 15 Hours Of Wrestling Each WeekDallas Cowboys Set to Defend AT&T Stadium in Week 2 Clash with New Orleans SaintsTovino on training for Kalaripayattu in ‘ARM’: I practiced every single day, even if I had a hectic day on set8 animals that reproduce without matingDelhi Police Files FIR for Firecracker Celebration Outside CM Kejriwal's ResidenceThrowback: When Alia Bhatt responded to insecurity questions about Ranbir Kapoor, shut down gossipIndia's T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav turns 34: A glimpse into his stellar T20 careerThe 3 Strongest Zodiac Signs: Powerhouses of the Zodiac Wheel7 benefits of drinking lemon water with black salt dailyCopyright © 2024 Bennett, Coleman & Co.
