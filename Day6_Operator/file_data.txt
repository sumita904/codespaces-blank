Mumbai, the capital city of Maharashtra state, was formerly known as Bombay. Now, it is also considered the financial and commercial capital of the country. The mega city has strong historical links, wonderful British architecture, museums, shrines, beaches and the Hindi film industry which is also known as Bollywood. The seven islands which form the metropolis were earlier home to fishing communities. For centuries, the islands were being controlled by the successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese and later to the East India Company of Great Britain. During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped with the construction of major roads and railways and subsequently it transformed into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea as we see it today. The city was renamed Mumbai in 1996. The happening city carries a vibrant and cosmopolitan culture. Be it Bollywood or Victorian-era buildings, Asia's largest slum in Dharavi or the lunchbox delivery and return system of the famous dabbawalas, every aspect of Mumbai boasts a unique identity.About usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesFOLLOW US ONOther Times Group News SitesThe Economic TimesHindi Economic TimesNavbharat TimesMaharashtra TimesVijaya KarnatakaTelugu SamayamTamil SamayamMalayalam SamayamI am GujaratTimesPointsIndiatimesBrand CapitalEducation TimesTimes FoodMumbai MirrorBangalore MirrorMX PlayerHindi PodcastPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth+ TipsIndian TV ShowsCelebrity PhotosTechnology NewsHot on the WebDeepika Padukone HouseDiljit DosanjhStree 2 CollectionVitamin B 12Weight GainVitaminsKanjeevaram SariAgra Heavy RainSister ShivaniDarlington Michaels Death NewsTop TrendsPrince HarryKarnataka ChaosArvind KejriwalNeeraj ChopraSandip GhoshTejashwi YadavNavdeep SinghSachin TendulkarLionel MessiTravis KelceUPI Transaction LimitTaylor SwiftVinesh PhogatKolkata Doctor Rape CaseElon MuskPM Narendra ModiLive Cricket ScoreTrending TopicsWorld Largest HorseEID WishesOnam WishesPriyanka Chopra TattooKottukkaali OTT ReleaseEngineers Day WishesGoat CollectionHair LossSudha MurtyMalayalam ProducersIndia's Best Dancer 4Simi GarewalDilli BabuIndian National ParksLaung BenefitsVikas SethiApple iPhone 16Donald TrumpAadhar Card UpdateWordle AnswerLiving and entertainmentETimesTravel DestinationsCricbuzz.comTVLifestyleNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTimes PrimeWhats HotServicesCouponDuniaTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgetsCareersColombiaLatest NewsPM Modi's Sunday roadshow in Jamshedpur cancelled due to heavy rain4 types of tea to improve gut health and ease digestive issuesFour Zodiac Signs That Are Hard to Control'Message for Modi': Opposition takes jab at BJP over Nitin Gadkari's 'PM post' claimNetflix denies filmmaker Soham Shah’s plagiarism allegations over Squid Games, says claim holds 'no merit'Weekly Career Horoscope, September 15 to September 21, 2024: Read your weekly astrological work predictions for all zodiac signsZodiac Signs That Crave a Luxurious Lifestyle"Miami Dolphins Owner Stephen Ross Eyes Multi-Billion Dollar Deal: The $7 Billion Power Play"Rajkummar Rao hails Kareena Kapoor Khan's The Buckingham Murders as a 'gripping thriller'MoS Finance likely to be convenor of GoM on GST compensation cessRole Rewind: Did you know Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone's love story has a strong Kareena Kapoor Khan connection?Coin Master free spins and coins for 15 September, 2024: Earn 7 million coins using today’s linksHow to set up partner sharing in Google PhotosIndia, Pakistan players involved in heated exchange during Asian Champions Trophy.
